**Gymnasium is a maintained fork of OpenAI’s Gym library.** The Gymnasium interface is simple, pythonic, and capable of representing general RL problems, and has a [migration guide](introduction/migration_guide/) for old Gym environments:
    
    
    import gymnasium as gym
    
    # Initialise the environment
    env = gym.make("LunarLander-v3", render_mode="human")
    
    # Reset the environment to generate the first observation
    observation, info = env.reset(seed=42)
    for _ in range(1000):
        # this is where you would insert your policy
        action = env.action_space.sample()
    
        # step (transition) through the environment with the action
        # receiving the next observation, reward and if the episode has terminated or truncated
        observation, reward, terminated, truncated, info = env.step(action)
    
        # If the episode has ended then we can reset to start a new episode
        if terminated or truncated:
            observation, info = env.reset()
    
    env.close()
